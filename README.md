### What I learned

I learned about how to add a fading shadowing on a element in CSS. 
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.box-shadow: 1px 2px 28px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.10);
```
### Continued development

* CSS/SASS
* Javascript 


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me with media queries and understand min-width and max-width.
